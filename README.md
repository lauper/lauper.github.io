My blog as a github repo
========================

This is the data for my blog.
It is automatically transformed by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

I do not want my blog posts ending up in a database off on some remote server.
I want to author my posts locally in Markdown.
My blog should be easily stylable and customizable any way I please.
It should take care of creating a feed for me.
